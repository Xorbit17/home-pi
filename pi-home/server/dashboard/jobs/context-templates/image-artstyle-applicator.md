The output aspect ratio is {aspect_ratio}.
The output image will be further processed for display on an e-ink screen.
So make sure to not generate an image that has any of these qualities:
* Bluriness unless art style requires it
* Large areas covered by gradients, prefer a lower numer of shades
* Lines with heavy antialising or blurry edges
* Extremely fine details in the range of 5 pixels or smaller
* Extra limbs for humans or animals
