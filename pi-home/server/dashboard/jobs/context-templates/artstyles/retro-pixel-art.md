# Style: Retro Pixel Art Portrait

## Core Style

- **Resolution & Grid**  
  Render at a low native resolution (e.g., 32×32 or 64×64). Every output pixel must align to the integer grid—no sub-pixel shifts. If only one or two people are present use a more coarse resolution, if more then to people are present use a little finer.

- **Palette & Color**  
  Use a **limited indexed palette** (8–32 colors) inspired by 8-/16-bit hardware (e.g., NES, Commodore 64, Amiga). Preserve separate ramps for skin, hair, shadow, and highlight—avoid blending or gradients.

- **Rendering & Edges**  
  Hard, crisp pixel edges only—no anti-aliasing. Optional subtle **dithering** (e.g., ordered/Bayer) may be used for mid-tones like cheeks or shadows but not on core facial features (eyes, mouth).

- **Facial Styling**  
  Emphasize minimal yet expressive features—1–3-pixel highlights in eyes, simplified hair shapes, minimal shading for nose/mouth. Prioritize readability and character over detail.

- **Background Treatment**  
  Simple flat tone or a two-color gradient reminiscent of retro UI backdrops or transform the background into a fictional game universe. Avoid noise or texture; maintain high contrast with the subject. 

## Transformation Procedure

1. **Analyze & Crop**  
   Detect the human subject and crop to a bust or head-and-shoulders framing. Correct lighting if necessary; isolate the background for replacement.

2. **Downscale**  
   Resize to target sprite size (32×32 or 64×64) using nearest-neighbor interpolation. Ensure pixels align perfectly without sub-pixel placement.

3. **Palette Quantization**  
   Convert to a constrained indexed palette. Map the image to this palette, maintaining consistent ramps for skin, hair, and shadows. Ideal palette is (red, green, blue, yellow, black, white) for the e-ink screen this is intented for. Shades of these colors and skintone is also acceptable.

4. **Optional Dithering**  
   If needed for tonal variation, apply ordered dithering very sparingly on shadow areas or hair. Keep facial features free of dithering distortion.

5. **Pixel Clean-Up**  
   Enforce grid alignment (snap any misaligned pixels). Simplify tiny artifacts. Refine features with manual—or tool-assisted—tweaks to ensure clarity.

6. **Background Replace**  
   Fill the background with a flat or two-step quantized gradient or transform the background into a fictional game universe. Ensure it contrasts nicely with the subject.

## Do

- Retain a strict pixel grid—no blur or smooth transitions.
- Use expressive minimalism—capture emotion with few pixels.
- Maintain palette consistency throughout.
- Prefer high contrast: bright hair/skin vs. dark background.

## Avoid

- Any form of anti-aliasing or gradient blending.
- Photographic details—textures, blur, smooth shading.
- Background clutter or complex backdrop patterns.
- Palette overflow or unintended color bleed.
