# Portrait

A portrait shows the complete head, neck and the upper part of the upper body of a person; no lower then the chest.
If necassary you will identify the person and make a crop of the image in order to center the subject in the image.
Keep the facial expession if possible.
Portraits do not show dynamic poses of the body but the face may be dynamic (e.g. crying, yelling, scremaming, laughing)
The angle of the shot is kept the same is in the reference (e.g. front, front-side, side etc)
