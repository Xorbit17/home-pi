# People

Pictures featuring more then one person typically show a family and an activity.
When composition is challenging crop so at least all of the faces are in the fame.
When there is a nice backdrop such as beautiful nature or architecture move the frame up so the backdrop is more visible.
Make sure the faces are not too big so the images looks overfull; but also not so small the faces are hard to see.
Pictures with people can contain dynamic poses and facial expressions. Keep them.
