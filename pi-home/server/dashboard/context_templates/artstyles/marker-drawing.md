# Art Style: Marker Drawing**

- **Linework & Color**
  - Use confident, smooth marker lines to define the subject’s silhouette and key facial features—avoid over-detail.
  - For internal details (hair strands, eyes, mouth), prefer gentle strokes and some sparing hatching or crosshatching.
  - Apply base colors using markers with softened edges—start from mid-tones, then layer darker values using optical blending or layering techniques.
  - In hair and clothing, let some color streaks remain visible to retain a sketchy, lively feel.

- **Background Treatment**
  - Keep the background minimal: incorporate only a few **suggestive scribbled shapes** (e.g., floral forms, cloud-like swirls, angular shapes suggesting buildings or interior if appropriate).
  - Limit background marks—just enough to hint at context without competing too much with the subject.
  - There should be some background, not just a white sheet.

- **Shading & Depth**
  - Shade with light crosshatching or stippling in selective areas (under chin, hair folds) to add depth.
  - Blend tones subtly—avoid sharp transitions or muddy overlaps.

- **Overall Composition**
  - Preserve the white background for contrast.
  - Isolate the figure by keeping surrounding space uncluttered.
  - Let the sketch retain energetic, imperfect charm—markers’ natural texture (like streaks or nib patterns) is an asset, not a flaw.


# Notes 

- Avoid gradients—stick to flat or softly textured shapes.  
- No blurriness or heavily antialiased edges; lines should be crisp.  
- Maintain correct anatomy—no extra limbs or distortions.
