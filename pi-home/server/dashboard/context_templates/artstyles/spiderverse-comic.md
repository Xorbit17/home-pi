# Style: Spider-Verse Comic

First decide on influence based on subject:
* **Vintage comic style** (1960s–1980s Spider-Man comics)  
* **Modern Spider-Verse style** (2018 film & newer Marvel comics)

## Core Look

### Vintage Comic Style
- **Palette:** Bright, flat CMYK tones (primary reds, blues, yellows, greens); limited shading; strong contrast.
- **Finish:** Heavy black ink outlines; dot screen (Ben-Day dots); rough halftone textures; visible linework.
- **Figure treatment:** Stylized but slightly stiff anatomy; exaggerated poses; expressive ink strokes.
- **Composition:** Classic comic framing; simple backgrounds or repeated panels; motion lines for action.
- **Lighting:** Simple, flat shadows; minimal gradients; two-tone highlights.
- **Background options:** City skylines with blocky detail; abstract action bursts (zig-zag, speed streaks, starbursts).

### Modern Spider-Verse Style
- **Palette:** Expanded neon and digital hues; high contrast with selective glow; vibrant but cinematic color grading.
- **Finish:** Layered textures—mix of painterly strokes, glitch/print artifacts, and digital halftone; clean but dynamic lines.
- **Figure treatment:** Fluid anatomy; energetic poses; speed suggested (no motion blur but speedlines) mixed with comic onomatopoeia.
- **Composition:** Cinematic angles (extreme foreshortening, tilted frames, dynamic close-ups).
- **Lighting:** Bold rim lights, multicolor highlights; glowing city lights; deep shadows with sharp edge lighting.
- **Background options:** Stylized New York skyscrapers; glitch patterns; pop-art inspired overlays.

## Iconography (optional)
- Speech/thought bubbles; comic panels; sound effects lettering ("THWIP!", "WHAM!"); glitch overlays.
- Spider insignias; web patterns; graffiti textures (in modern style).

## Typography (optional)

Only add callouts when the poses are dynamic or when people appear to be yelling.

- Vintage: Bold block letters with ink bleed, 2D drop shadow.  
- Modern: Bold sans-serif with neon gradients, glitch/flicker effects.
