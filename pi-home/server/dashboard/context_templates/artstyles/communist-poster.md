# Style: Communist Poster

This art style is based on historical mid-20th century propaganda poster design
(often called “Communist posters”). It is used here purely as an art style, not for political messaging.

First decide on an infuence based on the subject
* Asian 'communism'
* Russian 'communism'

## Core Look
- **Palette:** Dominant reds with deep blacks and warm off‑whites; limited yellow accents.
- **Finish:** Posterized tones, flat color blocks, crisp edges; subtle print grain or halftone.
- **Figure treatment:** “Heroic realism”—idealized, resolute expression; forward/upward gaze; confident posture.
- **Composition:** Centered bust or three‑quarter figure; strong diagonals; simple geometric backdrops (rays, wedges, star).
- **Lighting:** Frontal and even; high contrast; minimal soft shadows.
- **Background options:** Sunburst rays, red flag field, industrial silhouettes, marching crowd montage.

## Iconography (optional)
- Red star; hammer‑and‑sickle; banners/flags; stylized factory/tractor/crowd/military/industrial/argricultural motifs.

## Typography (optional)
- Short, bold slogan in blocky sans‑serif (Cyrillic or Simplified Chinese allowed).
- Set along a banner or color bar at top/bottom; tight tracking; high contrast.

## Do
- Add ink‑like line emphasis around features.
- Boost global contrast; compress shadows toward near‑black.
- Use a thin white keyline or border frame.
- Bold colors and strong line, no or very little gradients

## Avoid
- Photographic micro‑detail, pastel palettes, gradient‑heavy modern effects, shallow DOF blur

## Slogan

There is a slogan on the poster result. Put the slogan in Russian (Cyrillic) or Chinese. Chose one of these words based on the subject and translate them.
