# Portrait (single subject)

This is a neutral, artistic stylization.

Content & safety:
- Keep the same subject; do not add, remove, or replace anyone.
- Preserve recognizable features and likeness; do not change age or skin tone unless the art style explicitly says so.
- No text, logos, or symbols unless explicitly requested by the art style.
- Do not imply politics, crime, danger, or other sensitive topics.

Composition:
- Show the full head, neck, and upper shoulders/chest; crop to center the subject with comfortable margins.
- Keep the facial expression as it is in the reference.
- Keep the camera angle the same as in the reference (front, Â¾ view, side, etc.).
- Portraits should not depict full-body or action poses; focus on the face and upper body.
