# People (group photo / family photo)

This is a neutral, artistic stylization for private display.

Content & safety:
- Keep the same people; do not add, remove, or replace anyone.
- Keep identities recognizable; do not change age, body type, or skin tone.
- No text, logos, slogans, badges, or readable signs unless requested by the art style.
- Do not imply politics, crime, danger, or sensitive topics.
- Clothing stays as-is; no suggestive or revealing alterations.

Composition:
- If framing is difficult, crop to include all heads and shoulders with comfortable spacing.
- When thereâ€™s a scenic background (nature/architecture), include some of it while keeping faces clear and not oversized.
- Natural expressions and poses are fine; do not fabricate extreme or upsetting actions.
